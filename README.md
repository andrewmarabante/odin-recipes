My First HTML Project!

Alright Mr. Andrew, this is your first ever html project!! (clearly I'm stoked)

For this project I am just going to be making  a basic recipe website. This website will have links to some recipes and some pictures. (recipes will be my own as I'm just going to be creating them and using relative hrefs)
