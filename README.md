My First HTML Project!

Alright Mr. Andrew, this is your first ever html project!! (clearly I'm stoked)

For this project I am just going to be making  a basic recipe website. This website will have links to some recipes and some pictures. (recipes will be my own as I'm just going to be creating them and using relative hrefs)

After Project Summary:
This project was pretty straight forward and easy, I spent most of my time trying to come up with food choices, ingredients, and steps lol. I did learn that I cant just turn every picture into a jpg though.. So I just found jpg pictures instead of using the others... I need to learn how to implement those in the future. Also, I probably should've put alt's on the images.. NEXT TIME!
