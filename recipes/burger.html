            YEEEEE HAAAAAW COWBOY.
            Are you a big strong he/him, she/her, they/them, or any other politcally correct gender?
            Well do I have the burger for you.
            This burger was meant for a big strong someone that needs a big strong meal.
            With over 2,000 calories you can fuel your big strong muscles for lunch.
            Eat unhealthy.
            Don't apologize.
